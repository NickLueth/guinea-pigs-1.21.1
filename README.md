## 🧠 How the Mod Works

Here’s what to expect when you encounter guinea pigs in your world:

- 🌲 **Natural Spawns:** Guinea pigs spawn naturally in all **forest biomes**.
- 💩 **Droppings:** They leave behind **droppings** that function just like **bone meal** — use them to fertilize plants!
- 🌾 **Taming & Healing:** Use **wheat** to **tame** a wild guinea pig or **heal** a wounded one.
- 🌼 **Breeding:** Feed two guinea pigs a **dandelion** each to **breed** them.
- 🪑 **Sitting Behavior:** Right-click a **tamed** guinea pig to toggle **sit** mode.
